* Installation:
1) Make sure pygame is installed and up-to-date on your machine.
2) Install the font files located in the /fonts folder.
3) Run main.py with python or a text editor (such as Sublime Text 3)
4) Done!

* How to Play:
Each player controls a fighter on screen. To play, players must watch the screen for keys that pop up and hit the corresponding key on the keyboard.
The first player to reach 50 points wins the match!
Players can choose between an 'easy mode' and a 'hard mode'. In 'easy mode', Player 1 will only need to hit keys on the left half of the keyboard,
and vice versa for Player 2. In 'hard mode', players will need to fight over the entire keyboard to hit their respective keys.
